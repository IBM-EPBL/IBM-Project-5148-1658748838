About Project:

Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize digits handwritten by
humans. The problem is challenging because of unique handwritings possessed by every
individual - which means any given digit can be written in somewhat different shapes and sizes.
A model powerful enough to generalize the core characteristics of each digit can be used to
tackle this problem. MNIST Dataset contains images of over 10000 digits written by many
different people. A Convolutional Neural Network trained on this dataset can be used to
recognize handwritten digits.
